# CSCI-6511-Shortest-Path
Welcome to CSCI 6511 Artificial Intelligence course project. 
This project mainly uses informed and uninformed search to find the shortest path in given graphs.  

## Overview
UCS, uniform cost search, is used to implement uninformed search.  
A* algorithm is used to implement informed search.
